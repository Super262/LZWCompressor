# LZWCompressor
LzwCompressor is a software for compression and decompression with graphical interface (Qt 5) based on LZW algorithm. It runs smoothly and has a beautiful interface. The performance meets the requirements when compressing text files or 8-bit BMP (hamlet.txt (181KB) -> hamlet.lzwt (94KB)).

The executable file is located at "LZWCompressor/app".

At last, I must say that this project is only part of the assignment for my data structure course. Please do not use it for any commercial purpose!
