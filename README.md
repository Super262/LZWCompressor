# LZWCompressor
LZWCompressor is the software for compression and decompression with a graphical interface (Qt 5) based on the LZW algorithm. It runs smoothly and has a pretty interface. The performance meets the requirements when compressing text files or 8-bit BMP (hamlet.txt (181KB) -> hamlet.lzwt (94KB)). The executable file locates at "LZWCompressor/app/". This project is only part of the data structure course assignment. Please do not use it for any commercial purposes!
